# RocketSwagger

RocketSwagger is a hosted Swagger UI instance that allows users to visualize and interact with OpenAPI documentation. By simply passing the URL of an OpenAPI JSON schema, users can explore APIs effortlessly.

## How to Use

To utilize RocketSwagger, follow these simple steps:

   ```

3. Hit Enter or navigate to the modified URL.

You will now be directed to a Swagger UI instance displaying the documentation specified by the provided OpenAPI schema URL.
